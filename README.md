index.js has {createStore()} call being associated with a reducer (which is a function that manipulates state in response to directions) > Counter component gets a value prop which includes the state with store.getState() (which comes from the reducer and is auto-updated) > functions then call store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'}) to tell the reducer function to do something > main render method is then store.subscribe(render)d and updates the UI - the last part can be done with react-redux instead as per the main documentation to avoid the strange .subscribe(render) idiom

index with {createStore} being associated with a reducer > Counter gets a value prop which includes the state with store.getState() > functions then call store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'}) to tell the reducer to do something > main render method is then store.subscribe(render)d and updates the UI - the last part can be done with react-redux instead as per the main documentation to avoid the strange .subscribe(render) idiom
